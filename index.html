I am a Boas Assistant Professor at Northwestern University.

<br> <br> My interests are primarily in homotopy theory and its applications to problems in geometry and topology. In my PhD thesis, I classified complex topological vector bundles of rank three on complex projective five-space. I am currently thinking about other problems related to (unstable) vector bundles and how they can be studied using tools from homotopy theory. 

<br> <br>

I am also interested in homotopical aspects of algebraic geometry, e.g., motivic homotopy theory and its applications to algebraic vector bundles. My projects so far on algebraic geometry have involved analogues classical invariants (degree and Euler characteristic) in motivic homotopy theory. My interest in algebraic geometry goes back to my undergraduate thesis, where I studied extremal effective divisors on the moduli space of stable rational curves with marked points. 

<br> <br>

I have also worked on various topics related to abstract homotopy theory and its applications, including homotopy theory of graphs and homotopy type theory.

Before moving to Northwestern in July 2025, I was a Hedrick Assistant Adjunct Professor and NSF postdoc at UCLA, mentored by <a href="https://mikehill.math.umn.edu/">Mike Hill</a>. I completed my PhD at Harvard, where I worked with <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mjh/"> Michael J. Hopkins</a>. 
I completed my undergraduate studies at the <a href="http://www.math.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>, where I wrote an honors thesis in algebraic geometry with <a href="http://people.math.umass.edu/~tevelev/">Jenia Tevelev</a>. I began my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://www.capecod.edu/">Cape Cod Community College</a>.

<br><br>

For four years, I was an organizer for the  <a href="https://math.mit.edu/events/talbot/index.php?year=2023">MIT Talbot Workshop</a>. I am still happy to talk about Talbot, but queries related to upcoming Talbots should be directed to talbotworkshop AT gmail DOT com.

<!--I am on the postdoc job market this year (fall 2020) and I am prepared to give talks on my work on short notice!
